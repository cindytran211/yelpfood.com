                Problem Members Are Trying to Solve

            <p>
                The problem that our website is trying to solve is the fact that while there are many restaurant review websites, people are still struggling learning more information about certain types of food at different establishments. 
                This can be an issue with people that have certain allergies and food restrictions.
